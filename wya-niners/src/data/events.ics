DESCRIPTION:Ever heard of body doubling?\nBody doubling\, also known as pa
 rallel working\, is a productivity strategy where two or more people work
  on something independently but in the same space. Some students find the
 y are better able to focus and get more done when they are studying along
 side someone else studying.\n \nWhat are Accountability Groups?\nAccounta
 bility Groups meet weekly for 75 minutes and are facilitated by student l
 eaders. The groups are designed to capitalize on the idea of body doublin
 g by helping members practice productive study habits\, connect them with
  peers\, and provide dedicated time to work on individual tasks.\n \nJoin
  an Accountability Group through Connect! You can sign up as the semester
  goes on or ask to be placed in the same group weekly.\n \nThis group tha
 t meets on Mondays at 5:30pm is reserved for students with ADHD and ADHD-
 like experiences. \n\nHosted by: University Center for Academic Excellenc

DESCRIPTION:<!--StartFragment -->\nEver heard of body doubling?\nBody doub
 ling\, also known as parallel working\, is a productivity strategy where 
 two or more people work on something independently but in the same space.
  Some students find they are better able to focus and get more done when 
 they are studying alongside someone else studying.\n \nWhat are Accountab
 ility Groups?\nAccountability Groups meet weekly for 75 minutes and are f
 acilitated by student leaders. The groups are designed to capitalize on t
 he idea of body doubling by helping members practice productive study hab
 its\, connect them with peers\, and provide dedicated time to work on ind
 ividual tasks.\n \nJoin an Accountability Group through Connect! You can 
 sign up as the semester goes on or ask to be placed in the same group wee
 kly.\n \nThe group that meets on Mondays at 5:30pm is reserved for studen
 ts with ADHD and ADHD-like experiences.\n<!--EndFragment -->\n\nHosted by

DESCRIPTION:<!--StartFragment -->\nEver heard of body doubling?\nBody doub
 ling\, also known as parallel working\, is a productivity strategy where 
 two or more people work on something independently but in the same space.
  Some students find they are better able to focus and get more done when 
 they are studying alongside someone else studying.\n \nWhat are Accountab
 ility Groups?\nAccountability Groups meet weekly for 75 minutes and are f
 acilitated by student leaders. The groups are designed to capitalize on t
 he idea of body doubling by helping members practice productive study hab
 its\, connect them with peers\, and provide dedicated time to work on ind
 ividual tasks.\n \nJoin an Accountability Group through Connect! You can 
 sign up as the semester goes on or ask to be placed in the same group wee
 kly.\n \nThe group that meets on Mondays at 5:30pm is reserved for studen
 ts with ADHD and ADHD-like experiences.\n<!--EndFragment -->\n\nHosted by

DESCRIPTION:Ever heard of body doubling?\nBody doubling\, also known as pa
 rallel working\, is a productivity strategy where two or more people work
  on something independently but in the same space. Some students find the
 y are better able to focus and get more done when they are studying along
 side someone else studying.\n \nWhat are Accountability Groups?\nAccounta
 bility Groups meet weekly for 75 minutes and are facilitated by student l
 eaders. The groups are designed to capitalize on the idea of body doublin
 g by helping members practice productive study habits\, connect them with
  peers\, and provide dedicated time to work on individual tasks.\n \nJoin
  an Accountability Group through Connect! You can sign up as the semester
  goes on or ask to be placed in the same group weekly.\n \nThis group tha
 t meets on Mondays at 5:30pm is reserved for students with ADHD and ADHD-
 like experiences. \n\nHosted by: University Center for Academic Excellenc

DESCRIPTION:<!--StartFragment -->\nEver heard of body doubling?\nBody doub
 ling\, also known as parallel working\, is a productivity strategy where 
 two or more people work on something independently but in the same space.
  Some students find they are better able to focus and get more done when 
 they are studying alongside someone else studying.\n \nWhat are Accountab
 ility Groups?\nAccountability Groups meet weekly for 75 minutes and are f
 acilitated by student leaders. The groups are designed to capitalize on t
 he idea of body doubling by helping members practice productive study hab
 its\, connect them with peers\, and provide dedicated time to work on ind
 ividual tasks.\n \nJoin an Accountability Group through Connect! You can 
 sign up as the semester goes on or ask to be placed in the same group wee
 kly.\n \nThe group that meets on Mondays at 5:30pm is reserved for studen
 ts with ADHD and ADHD-like experiences.\n<!--EndFragment -->\n\nHosted by
