Some students find they are better able to focus and get more done when they are studying alongside someone else studying.\n\u00a0\nWhat are Accountability Groups?\nAccountability Groups\u00a0meet weekly for 75 minutes and are facilitated by student leaders. The groups are designed to capitalize on the idea of body doubling by helping members practice productive study habits, connect them with peers, and provide dedicated time to work on individual tasks.\n\u00a0\nJoin an Accountability Group through Connect! You can sign up as the semester goes on or ask to be placed in the same group weekly.\n\u00a0\nThe group that meets on Mondays at 5:30pm is reserved for students with ADHD and ADHD-like experiences.\n<!--EndFragment -->",
