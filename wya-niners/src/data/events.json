The groups are designed to capitalize on the idea of body doubling by helping members practice productive study habits, connect them with peers, and provide dedicated time to work on individual tasks.\n\u00a0\nJoin an Accountability Group through Connect!

The groups are designed to capitalize on the idea of body doubling by helping members practice productive study habits, connect them with peers, and provide dedicated time to work on individual tasks.\n\u00a0\nJoin an Accountability Group through Connect! You can sign up as the semester goes on or ask to be placed in the same group weekly.\n\u00a0\nThe group that meets on Mondays at 5:30pm is reserved for students with ADHD and ADHD-like experiences.\n<!--EndFragment -->",

For the rest of the time, we'll look at programming/coding problem together and split into pair programming groups to try and come up with solutions collaboratively. We will also set aside some time to discuss current topics and interests in tech and/or spend additional time workshopping resumes or interview skills with our peers.",
